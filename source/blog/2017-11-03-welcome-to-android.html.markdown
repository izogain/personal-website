For a whole range of reasons I recently bought a Google Pixel 2. Thankfully, I
think it's been the right decision. On top of all the benefits I was expecting -
such as the improved camera, speed and customisability over my iPhone 6 - there
were a number of other surprising features that I've found really helpful.

The first feature is background tab opening from other apps. I get email news
roundups and open links from there. This feature allows me to 'queue' a whole
series of links for the next time I open Firefox - without leaving my email
client. There's a little pop-up if I did ever want to open a link right away.

Firefox also allows me to set my homepage to open when I open new tabs. I have
built my own page with a series of links I like to start from and having this as
my default new tab page is really nice, if a small touch.

iOS is pretty fast to kill background apps. I had real issues with larger
uploads to slack and Dropbox. In Android these uploads get a dedicated
notification so I can see when and if they complete. No more returning to a
slack conversation only to find the file never sent. Slack generally is
noticably faster on Android. Even vs an iPhone 8 - I'm not sure what's going on
with the iOS slack client.

The final windfall feature is the simplest of all. Android apparently has what
is effectively an alt tab feature activated by double pressing the square menu
button. This is really useful for copying and pasting from 1password, and yes, I
find this faster than the iOS browser integration.

I also haven't even taken my pixel charger out of the box - USB-C chargers for
the win.
